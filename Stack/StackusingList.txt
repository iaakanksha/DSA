As we all know how stack works on the basis of LIFO (Last In First Out) method. It means the Last inserted element will be removeed first and so on.
In this fashion by obvious means the first inserted element will be removed at last.
Here in this program I have created all the posiible operations done on the stack at one place. 
Traditionally, 3 main operations are done on the stack.
   1. POP (Remove th element)
   2. PUSH (Add the element)
   3. isEmpty (To check whether the stack is empty or not at initial state)

Here for POP & PUSH function we have used POP and APPEND methods respectively.
Its a menu driven program.
