  1. Manually by defining diff functions
  2. By using modules 
      modules
        1. Collection
        2. Queue
Here we have implemented the Collection module.
In this, the module name is Collection and class name is deque()
append() is used as  PUSH function to add/insert the element.
pop () is used as POP function to remove the element.
