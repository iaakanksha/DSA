Stack could be implmented in 2 ways:
  1. Manually by defining diff functions
  2. By using modules 
      modules
        1. Collection
        2. queue
Here we have implemented the queue module.
In this, the module name is queue and class name is LifoQueue()
put() is used as  PUSH function to add/insert the element.
get() is used as POP function to remove the element.
