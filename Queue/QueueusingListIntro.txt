Whats is QUEUE?

QUEUE is  a data structure which works on FIFO (First In First Out) OR LILO (Last In Last Out) fashion.
It means the first entered element will take exit first where as the elementat the last position will exit at last. 
Its totally similar to our day-to-day life QUEUE which we create at Cinema Theatre to buy the tickets and other places.
Elements in QUEUE can be added from both the ends and same goes for removal of elements. 
The front end is called as FRONT and the back end is called as TAIL/REAR.
The method of inserting element in the QUEUE is called as enqueue where as the method of removing/deleting the element from QUEUEis called as dequeue.




In this program the QUEUE is implemented using list.
As you already know purpose of append() and pop() from the stack but if not then please first take  alook at it first.
Here, pop(0) is used to remove the element from the front-side of QUEUE.
If we fail to do that then it will simply act as the STACK.

We have used insert(0,52) as insert(index value,element value) 
0 index value shows that we are inserting the element from the front-side of the QUEUE.  

To check the elemnts at front and rear ends in the QUEUE we use index numbers as 0 and -1 respectively.
